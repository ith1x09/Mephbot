Mephbot development log
Copyright (c) 2002 by Mike Gogulski

Version 0.91 Changes

(hopefully) squashed a crashy bug in AutomationThreadProc

fixed weapon switch bug introduced in 0.9

packetized weapon switch

FINALLY (I hope and pray) fixed the mana recovery bug which caused people
to stop in the middle of teleporting to Meph, only to get thrashed by the
Council.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.91 TODO

===========================
  Fixes/Improvements TODO
===========================

configurable vertical offset for mouse clicks (only one left!!!)

configurable potion buy delay (may no longer be necessary)

Account for changes to fast cast % on weapon switch

For spell casting, we have to select the skill if it's not selected, then wait
for the server to confirm that we have that skill selected BEFORE we send the
cast packet.  The time that we need to wait is approximately equal to the 
average round-trip ping time from client to server, plus a small pad to account
for processing/queueing delay at each end.  THIS IS ANNOYINGLY DIFFICULT TO
CODE.

Hmmm... we could make a STATE_CAST to which we pass a spell name, hand, X/Y,
next state, and Tick1 value to restore...

Timing for lightning, chain lightning, and inferno is currently wrong since 
these depend on IAS, not Fast Cast (noted in mephbot.txt)

Use BNHackit to automate out-of-game control functions once it's released

=====================
  New Features TODO
=====================

Switch the whole damn thing to using Gameinfo's memory hooks for game data

Replace AutoIT wrapper script with a C++/MFC program
	(IN PROGRESS)

Packet debug to screen currently causes crashes (need to handle extra-long
lines better)
	(I DO NOT INTEND TO FIX THIS)

Handle gold inventory full condition (see IPB)
	(I DO NOT INTEND TO IMPLEMENT THIS)

Game difficulty selection
	(I DO NOT INTEND TO IMPLEMENT THIS)

Use fastwp 1.2 to get to act 3 wp 1 at first game join if not in kurast docks, then quit
	maybe just use excerpt of gayak's code rather than the whole module?
	(I DO NOT INTEND TO IMPLEMENT THIS UNTIL AFTER 1.10 IF NOT PATCHED)

add support for off-realm games (BNETD, peer-peer)
	(I DO NOT INTEND TO IMPLEMENT THIS)

Merc support - see FallNAngel's IPB Code
	requires: asheara visit, death detection, health monitor, feed potion
	hmmm.... mercs die pretty quick... mostly pointless...
	(I DO NOT INTEND TO IMPLEMENT THIS)

after one char's inventory is full, start running another char
	(I DO NOT INTEND TO IMPLEMENT THIS) (write your own batch file)

alternating attack sequence, say to let the user configure two spells (orb and
hydra for example) to alternate between
	(I DO NOT INTEND TO IMPLEMENT THIS)

fully user-configurable attack sequence (impossible, i say)
	(I DO NOT INTEND TO IMPLEMENT THIS)

per-character configuration in INI for all values
	(I DO NOT INTEND TO IMPLEMENT THIS)

=====================
  External Projects
=====================

Guillaume's installer/configurator

Something like IPB watcher to replace/augment overheadinfo()

Sharantyr's ChangeChar when inv full (should be integrated?)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.9 Changes

We now move ALL unid'd items to stash AND cube, removed mover.d2h from ZIP
	CUBE MUST BE IN STASH!!! (largest items are moved first)

Spell casting is now visible

Fixed erroneous deletion of repair trigger in 0.8 (oops!)

We now support up to 8 precasts

configurable "dodging on/off" parameter in INI

Changed "/" to VK_DIVIDE in key sending routines... Hopefully this fixes the
problems experienced by users with non-US keyboards.

We should now select and buy only the best of Ormus's healing potions

Increased potion buy delay... should fix some people who were failing to buy
potions at all

Packetized character resurrection and corpse pickup functions.  Removed
tr.d2h from distribution

Added user-configurable %life at which to drink healing potion

Added configurable option to keep running after inventory full

Eliminated all mouse clicks from wrapper script

Added CriticalSection checks around linked list operations, which should
eliminate some crashes

Cleaned up poor memory management in automation.cpp

We're now using dClick in d2h module as well as wrapper

eliminated auto-minimize on d2hackit startup (let user determine when instead)

moved maphack path-building later in run to prevent crashes in DrawAutomapAct()

Cleaned up some debugging information, moved things to proper debug levels

On game join, we now reset the timer in wrapper to 0.  This helps ensure that
once a game starts to actually be created, we don't abort it prematurely.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.8 Changes

FIRST GENERAL RELEASE (bugfixes only)

Added readme.txt with FAQ and other info to distribution

Fixed a divide-by-zero error in STATE_TELEPORT_TO_MEPH that could be triggered
if MaxMP is unset.

Removed default protection spells from d2h module to avoid errors with people
who only configured 0-2 protection spells.

Fixed numerous flaws in my "98% crash-free" pickit 0.86x.

We now correctly report game started in wrong act rather than inventory full.

We now recover mana in a separate state to avoid stopping in the middle of 
the teleport to meph sequence.

Eliminated gt.d2h from distribution.  Internalized potion-drinking and 
triggers formerly handled by gt and tr.  Should fix a bug reported where only
potions in belt slot 1 were being used.

CreateStairsPath() now uses Durance 2 waypoint location rather than player
location to work properly all the time.  This fixes a bug which was causing
an abort in about 15% of games.

MaxHP and MaxMP settings are now more reliable, which should result in 
fewer unnecessary chickens.

Increased minimum length of game names... should result in fewer "A game with
that name already exists" failures.

We're now dodging only when Meph casts his Ice Ball attack.  Even though
dodging still isn't perfect, this should result in faster kills overall.

Corrected a small bug in STATE_CAST_PROTECTION timing which *may* result in
more reliable precasting.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.7 Changes

SECOND BETA RELEASE

Improved stairs-finding using Dijkstra's shortest-path algorithm

Protection and Attack Skills (except static and teleport) settable in INI

We now support EVERY Sorceress skill including "Normal Attack" and throwing
attacks.  Chain Lightning, Lightning, and Inferno, however, have timing
problems and are NOT recommended.

Protection Spell precast routine should now be 98% reliable

Eliminated ExitProcess() from code.  This was causing crashes on some systems
(Win98 in particular).

Dodging: Implemented Gayak's contributed Telesafe() algorithm, which results in
fewer player deaths at some small expense in average run speed. (Thanks Gayak!)

Fixed brain-damaged TeleportAway() algorithm.

Incorporated my own hacked-up version of Pickit 0.86b (pickit 0.86x).  Should
be 98% crash-free.

Fixed broken pickit HTML header file

Eliminated DeltaTeleport and MaxDistFromStairs user options (hard-coded to 40)

Eliminated "cast during teleport" feature (useless)

Eliminated MaxTryRestart user option (no longer needed)

Removed all references to AutoIT DLL and #defines for USE_AUTOIT

Removed all references to TextDisplay.cpp

Fixed flag file deletion in wrapper script

Eliminated chicken sound (*sniff!*)

We now support healing potions other than supers (for norm & nightmare)

Changed chat socket/game socket detection to look for D2 TCP 4000 socket
instead of b.net 6112 sockets... should be more compatible with b.net chat bots

Switched all item drop parsing from Shopbot code to PKTK code (sorry, Cigamit)

Eliminated MaxTickRepair and RepairGameNumber options (durability check works)

We won't buy potions if we already have 12 or more in belt

Fixed a bug in Meph range detection that kept us too close to him

We now calculate spell delays based on fast cast % and skill data table
(no more DelayCast* config in INI)

Improved how we handle logging to file.  We only fopen() once, which should
mean less disk I/O and therefore less lag on slower systems.

Eliminated -direct -txt as default options.  D2Accelerator users will want
to add these parameters back into D2Parameter= in the [_expert_] section
of mephbot.ini

The bot will now stop immediately (and erroneously report inventory full) if
it's started someplace other than Act 3, Kurast Docks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.6 Changes

FIRST BETA RELEASE

Mephbot now runs minimized!

The AutoIT DLL is now no longer required

Faster stairs-finding algorithm thanks to Gayak

We now only launch a repair game when an equipped item is damaged to
10% of its durability

StairsObjID detection is now 100% deterministic thanks to Gayak

Eliminated keystrokes and mouseclicks from nearly all in-game functions

Fixed string-printing bug which was causing occasional assertion failures.

Fixed much programming stupidity

We now simply quit altogether when we have a full player inventory

HUGE amounts of new debugging output is available

Moved some game startup stuff out of OnGameJoin into STATE_GAME_STARTED

Added packet-level debugging from sniffer.d2h and pktident.d2h

made MephWeaponSwitchHealth a percentage in INI

moved "tr" configuration commands into tr.ini

Fixed player death detection

Ultra-agressive chickening with ExitProcess()

Improved logic that determines if we're near the stairs

Eliminated my quaffer.d2h module from the distribution

Changed pickit.ini to no longer pick up any potions (we don't need them)

We're now using herzog_zwei's mover.d2h to move 1x1 items to stash
	(except small charms)

We visit stash only every (user configurable number of) games

Added tr.d2h filters to ensure we're not seeing/picking up potions/bolts/etc.

Increased potion-quaff-at-resurrection number from 40 to 56 to be DAMN SURE

Fixed handling of player death simultaneous to Meph death

Fixed a bug in TeleportRandomly() that wasn't properly resetting the random
vectors list

We now load tr before pickit to ensure that tr's "hide" function works

We now calculate DeltaTeleportAway, and eliminated user config

Eliminated DelayTeleport (== DelayCastQuickSpell)

Localized as many variables as possible for more thread-safe operation

Added user option to move D2 window into top-left corner of screen

Added user option to disable debug to screen but still debug to file

Added support for multiple debug levels/flags

Moved a bunch of utility and logging functions off into their own .cpp files

We will chicken out at HP 40% and MP 10% (energy shield about to fall)

After taking stairs to durance 3, we will wait until mana >  70% before 
beginning the teleport to meph run

Added a sanity check to STATE_START_NEW_GAME that makes sure we have two
TCP/IP connections to battle.net open before sending start game commands

Made hp/mp display percentages rather than absolutes when maxima are available

Fixed overzealous window killing in wrapper script which prevented Diablo 
from writing debug information to its logfile

We now play a remarkably amusing WAV file after chickening out

No more skill hotkey configuration. We select skills with packets now
NOTE: Skills are not configuratble in this releast

We do gold deposit all with packets now

Added a chicken counter (we them count before they're hatched)

Fixed a gold deposit bug where we were closing the stash too early

Added better logging in the wrapper script

Suggested fixes for memory consumption and crash protection to Gayak
for use in pickit 0.86b, which he implemented, and we now include

Fixed bad math in TeleportToward() and TeleportAway()

We build all packets the same way in all functions now

Now using 0x04 "run to entity, click entity" packet in takestairs()

Fixed an OverheadInfo() bug which may have caused odd game behavior

Weapon switch should now be 100% reliable, as we're tracking weapon state
with packet 0x9d17 messages. We're storing weapon state info and primary
weapon selection in the INI for correct weapon selection on D2 restart
after chicken or crash 

We now quit game without packets, keystrokes or mouseclicks, thanks to
D2ExitGame() from Mousepad's maphack.

Got rid of "mepbot-killme.tmp" in favor of D2ExitGame(0)

We now chicken by calling D2ExitGame(0)... much more direct than the old 
0x66 method.

Replaced pause packets/keystrokes with pause messages in the serialization
queue

We now join random channel and set away message only when the module first
starts up.

Fixed a bug in GetCurrentLevel() which caused crashes when we asked for 
the current level before D2 had populated its unit structures fully

We now track skill selection so we don't have to reselect teleport a thousand
times

We now auto-drink any health potion which falls to inventory using packets.
Should prevent potions from filling up inventory on resurrection after death.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 0.5 Changes

SECOND ALPHA RELEASE

Removed OnCommandToggle and OnCommandReload

Added debug logging for the AUT script

we now do a weapon reset before all aborts (except when wrapper kills D2)

more debugging output in mephbot.d2h

added life and mana readout to overhead status

some code maintainability improvements

added explicit length declaration for hotkey strings

removed default declarations for hotkey strings... this was serving to conceal
programming errors

Fixed major bugs in STATE_ATTACK_MEPH... we weren't resetting
HotKeyPrimaryLeftAttack at all... now we do.  Also, we're now doing spell
casting in the correct order and with sensible use of the timers and delays.

added a missing colon after DeleteInGameFile: label in autoit script

we now reset weapon IMMEDIATELY after meph dies

changed strings of spaces to {SPACE x}

Made pickup time configurable from INI (DelayPickup)

Added check to restart everything if no game started within 60 seconds

Fixed a bug in the AutoIT script where we were checking game state every
millisecond instead of every second

We now get mephbotdir value from AutoIt environment, no user config needed

We now unload pickit at game start, load it pre-enabled on entering Durance 3

Added open stash/deposit gold function

Moved "gt maxhp" setting to after casting first protection spells... should
now be 100% accurate

Added ChickenHPPercent setting to kill client if life below thresshold.

incorporated repair.d2h functions into this module

incorporated buyer.d2h potion buy function into mephbot.d2h

Added flag check to make sure we're not doing runs with full inventory

Statistics now persist across game crash/restart, get logged to mephbot-stats.ini

Fixed buggy weapon switch code (changed a while to an if)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

having "gt stop" so close to game exit may cause a crash
	increased default game exit timer to 3 seconds

need to have d2h signal aut that we're in game
	also signal a panic somehow, like if TickGame > MaxTickGame * 2
	(though this would cover up bugs)
	mephbot.aut needs a timer to determine
		if timer > x and notexist (file that says .d2h is in game)
